{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"description":"The first version of the Instagram API is an exciting step forward towards\nmaking it easier for users to have open access to their data. We created it\nso that you can surface the amazing content Instagram users share every\nsecond, in fun and innovative ways.\n\nBuild something great!\n\nOnce you\u0027ve\n[registered your client](http://instagram.com/developer/register/) it\u0027s easy\nto start requesting data from Instagram.\n\nAll endpoints are only accessible via https and are located at\n`api.instagram.com`. For instance: you can grab the most popular photos at\nthe moment by accessing the following URL with your client ID\n(replace CLIENT-ID with your own):\n```\n  https://api.instagram.com/v1/media/popular?client_id\u003dCLIENT-ID\n```\nYou\u0027re best off using an access_token for the authenticated user for each\nendpoint, though many endpoints don\u0027t require it.\nIn some cases an access_token will give you more access to information, and\nin all cases, it means that you are operating under a per-access_token limit\nvs. the same limit for your single client_id.\n\n\n## Limits\nBe nice. If you\u0027re sending too many requests too quickly, we\u0027ll send back a\n`503` error code (server unavailable).\nYou are limited to 5000 requests per hour per `access_token` or `client_id`\noverall. Practically, this means you should (when possible) authenticate\nusers so that limits are well outside the reach of a given user.\n\n## Deleting Objects\nWe do our best to have all our URLs be\n[RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).\nEvery endpoint (URL) may support one of four different http verbs. GET\nrequests fetch information about an object, POST requests create objects,\nPUT requests update objects, and finally DELETE requests will delete\nobjects.\n\nSince many old browsers don\u0027t support PUT or DELETE, we\u0027ve made it easy to\nfake PUTs and DELETEs. All you have to do is do a POST with _method\u003dPUT or\n_method\u003dDELETE as a parameter and we will treat it as if you used PUT or\nDELETE respectively.\n\n## Structure\n\n### The Envelope\nEvery response is contained by an envelope. That is, each response has a\npredictable set of keys with which you can expect to interact:\n```json\n{\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"code\": 200\n    },\n    \"data\": {\n        ...\n    },\n    \"pagination\": {\n        \"next_url\": \"...\",\n        \"next_max_id\": \"13872296\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### META\nThe meta key is used to communicate extra information about the response to\nthe developer. If all goes well, you\u0027ll only ever see a code key with value\n200. However, sometimes things go wrong, and in that case you might see a\nresponse like:\n```json\n{\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"error_type\": \"OAuthException\",\n        \"code\": 400,\n        \"error_message\": \"...\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### DATA\nThe data key is the meat of the response. It may be a list or dictionary,\nbut either way this is where you\u0027ll find the data you requested.\n#### PAGINATION\nSometimes you just can\u0027t get enough. For this reason, we\u0027ve provided a\nconvenient way to access more data in any request for sequential data.\nSimply call the url in the next_url parameter and we\u0027ll respond with the\nnext set of data.\n```json\n{\n    ...\n    \"pagination\": {\n        \"next_url\": \"https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/puppy/media/recent?access_token\u003dfb2e77d.47a0479900504cb3ab4a1f626d174d2d\u0026max_id\u003d13872296\",\n        \"next_max_id\": \"13872296\"\n    }\n}\n```\nOn views where pagination is present, we also support the \"count\" parameter.\nSimply set this to the number of items you\u0027d like to receive. Note that the\ndefault values should be fine for most applications - but if you decide to\nincrease this number there is a maximum value defined on each endpoint.\n\n### JSONP\nIf you\u0027re writing an AJAX application, and you\u0027d like to wrap our response\nwith a callback, all you have to do is specify a callback parameter with\nany API call:\n```\nhttps://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/coffee/media/recent?access_token\u003dfb2e77d.47a0479900504cb3ab4a1f626d174d2d\u0026callback\u003dcallbackFunction\n```\nWould respond with:\n```js\ncallbackFunction({\n    ...\n});\n```\n","version":"v1","title":"Instagram API","termsOfService":"http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api"},"host":"api.instagram.com","basePath":"/v1","tags":[{"name":"Users"},{"name":"Relationships","description":"Relationships are expressed using the following terms:\n\n**outgoing_status**: Your relationship to the user.
